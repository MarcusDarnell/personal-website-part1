        <h1>My story</h1>
        <p>My name is Marcus Darnell and I am excited to learn and grow in this field. I had my first child at the age of nineteen. I went to Humboldt State University to study Botany, but as it turned out, life had other plans for me. Consequently, I needed to move back to my home town of Hollister, Callifornia. I then explored the handyman/home renovation services, and within this time I had my second daughter. Soon after, I found a great passion for cooking food and decided to persue education at a culinary school in San Jose, California. This is when I enrolled at a culinary institute named the International Culinary Center. The school was a branch from their main campus in New York City. My experience at this school was exceptional. I learned incredible things about the culinary world, as well as learning about my strengths. Sadly, this branch that was located in Campbell is now no longer in operation. Food is a necessity so it is no surprise that the culinary field is wildly demanding and extremely tiring, and after a decade of exploring this career path I decided to venture out and test my strengths elsewhere. In 2020, my family welcomed my third child; a son. My three beautiful kids are my evrything and being a single father is very difficult and only furthered my decision to leave the field. In the last 2 years, life has thrown me a huge curve ball which has caused me to have to overcome many obsticales. Facing these adversities has allowed me to grow and become the person that I am today. I always love to geek out on things like video games and anything science. I feel everything happens for a reason - sorry for the cliche. I can not wait to learn and evolve in this new chapter and oppurtunity in my life.</p>
        <h2>things that make me - me!</h2>
        <p>I love art! I love to draw and have recently started tattooing. I really enjoy using charcoal, but I am always trying out new mediums. I grew up skateboarding and snowboarding. I love to rock climb, and to be out in nature is quite a pleasure for me. My daughters are 10 and 6 and my son is 3 years old. They mean the world to me and are truly the biggest thing that makes me who I am. Being the the best father I can be has pushed me to develop skills such as patience, love, kindness, understanding, and problem solving. All of which will apply well to my work ethic and character.</p>
